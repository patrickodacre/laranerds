## About Laranerds

This application started as a Laravel Jetstream app. I completed some minor tweaks to remove Tailwind and Vite to use Laravel Mix and Boostrap 5 instead.

This application is meant as a playground to build and demo various features commonly found in large business applications.

I hope you find something useful to use in your own work.
